# Global GHG Emissions Analysis and Visualization

# Objective
The objective of this project is to analyze global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and create visualizations using Tableau. The aim is to understand trends, sources, and impacts of GHG emissions and provide actionable insights for reducing them.

# Scope of Data
Time Period: 1990 to 2022
Geographical Coverage: Global, with detailed focus on major emitting countries
Sectors Covered: Energy, transportation, industrial processes, and more
Emissions Types: CO2, CH4, N2O, and other greenhouse gases

# Source of Data
Primary Sources: https://edgar.jrc.ec.europa.eu/report_2023#data_download

# Justification
This data on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by sector and country was chosen because it provides a comprehensive and detailed view of how different countries and sectors contribute to global emissions over a significant period, from 1970 to 2022. Given the global urgency to address climate change, having such granular data is crucial for developing targeted policies and strategies to reduce emissions effectively.
The importance of this data lies in its ability to identify trends, highlight major sources of emissions, and track the effectiveness of implemented measures over time. By analyzing the data, policymakers, researchers, and industry stakeholders can understand the progress made and the areas that require more attention and resources.

# Key Questions of Analysis
What are the global trends in GHG emissions from 1990 to 2022?
Which sectors contribute the most to global GHG emissions?
Which countries are the largest emitters of GHGs?
How do emissions vary on a per capita basis among different countries?
What are the future projections for GHG emissions under current policies?
What are the key limitations in the current data and analysis?
